Place OCR language files here to keep OCR fully client-side.

Recommended:
- Download: eng.traineddata (or eng.traineddata.gz)
- Put it in this folder so it is served from your own domain:
    public/tessdata/eng.traineddata

If you do not provide this file, the "Exact-look (raster + OCR)" mode may not be searchable.
