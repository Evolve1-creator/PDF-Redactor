Place OCR language files here to keep OCR fully client-side.

Recommended:
- Download Tesseract language data: eng.traineddata (or eng.traineddata.gz)
- Put it in this folder so it is served from your own domain:
    /tessdata/eng.traineddata

This avoids fetching language data from third-party CDNs.
